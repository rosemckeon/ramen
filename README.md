# Ramen

**Hopefully Ramen will become a Shiny App template which provides the latest Bootstrap to use as a theme for `bootstrapPage()`, as well as web developer tools for enhanced appearance modification and loading times.**

Ramen makes use of bower and npm to handle development dependencies, enabling Gulp, which is used to minify assets and compile SCSS into fast loading distribution files.

1. Edit `./assets` 
2. Run `$ gulp` from the project root, via terminal.
3. Files output to `./www` are made available to your App.

> `./assets/manifest.json` controls distribution output (see [Manifest help](https://github.com/austinpray/asset-builder/tree/master/help)).
